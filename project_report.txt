
Clinical Information Extraction — Prompt-Based Experiment
----------------------------------------------------------
Model: google/flan-t5-large
Samples: 20
Disease accuracy:  70.0 %
Severity accuracy: 100.0 %

Notes:
- Zero-shot → model repeated template
- One-shot → partial extraction
- Few-shot → consistent disease extraction
- Two-step prompting + sampling → improved severity

Conclusion:
Using open-source FLAN-T5 models, prompt engineering alone
achieves meaningful structured extraction for short clinical
notes, mirroring the early stages of Shan Wang et al. (2024).
